    "\n",
    "The main objective of this tutorial is to show integrate the [orca processor] (https://github.com/VectorBlox/orca) with the overlay built to test various RISC processors. It is highly advisable to first try and finish the tutorial notebooks where a pico processor is packaged and run in a PYNQ Z1 board. This also applies to the PYNQ Z2 board. We assume that those tutorials have already been tried and tested by the user.\n",

    "These are the steps to integrate the Orca Processor with the Base Overlay:\n",
    "1. Clone the orca repository\n",
    "2. Open Vivado and package the Orca overlay and create IP\n",
    "3. Attach IP with the base overlay inspired by connections to the Zedboard\n",
    "4. Generate Bitstream and Tcl files for the new overlay and follow the steps in [tutorial-4] (https://github.com/drichmond/RISC-V-On-PYNQ/blob/master/notebooks/tutorial/4-Packaging-An-Overlay.ipynb)\n",
